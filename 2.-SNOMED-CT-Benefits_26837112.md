This section provides an overview of how effective use of SNOMED CT:

  * Benefits populations
  * Benefits individual patients and clinicians
  * Supports evidence based healthcare



## Why is this important?

Understanding the benefits of [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT") will inform key decisions and the development of strategies for adoption, implementation and use of this clinical terminology.

## What is this?

[SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT") supports the development of comprehensive high-quality clinical content in health records. It provides a standardized way to represent clinical phrases captured by the clinician and enables automatic interpretation of these. [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT") is a clinically validated, semantically rich, controlled vocabulary that facilitates evolutionary growth in expressivity to meet emerging requirements.

### Electronic Health Records

[SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT") based clinical information benefits individual patients and clinicians as well as populations and it supports evidence based care.

The use of an [Electronic Health Record](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Electronic+Health+Record "Glossary link: Electronic Health Record") (EHR) improves communication and increases the availability of relevant information. If clinical information is stored in ways that allow meaning-based retrieval, the benefits are greatly increased. The added benefits range from increased opportunities for real time decision support to more accurate retrospective reporting for research and management.

### SNOMED CT Enabled Health Records Benefit Individuals

SNOMED CT enabled clinical health records benefit individuals by:

  * Enabling relevant clinical information to be recorded using consistent, common representations during a consultation.
  * Enabling guideline and decision support systems to check the record and provide real-time advice, for example, through clinical alerts.
  * Supporting the sharing of appropriate information with others involved in delivering care to a patient through data capture that allows understanding and interpretation of the information in a common way by all providers.
  * Allowing accurate and comprehensive searches that identify patients who require follow-up or changes of treatment based on revised guidelines.
  * Removing language barriers ( [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT") enables multilingual use).




### SNOMED CT Enabled Health Records Benefit Populations

[SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT") enabled clinical health records benefit populations by:

  * Facilitating early identification of emerging health issues, monitoring of population health and responses to changing clinical practices.
  * Enabling accurate and targeted access to relevant information, reducing costly duplications and errors.
  * Enabling the delivery of relevant data to support clinical research and contribute evidence for future improvements in treatment.
  * Enhancing audits of care delivery with options for detailed analysis of clinical records to investigate outliers and exceptions.



### SNOMED CT Enabled Health Records Support Evidence-Based Healthcare

SNOMED CT enabled health records inform evidence based health care decisions by:

  * Enabling links between clinical records and enhanced clinical guidelines and protocols.
  * Enhancing the quality of care experienced by individuals.
  * Reducing costs of inappropriate and duplicative testing and treatment.
  * Limiting the frequency and impact of adverse healthcare events.
  * Raising the cost-effectiveness and quality of care delivered to populations.
